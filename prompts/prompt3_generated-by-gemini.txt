pubspec.yaml.

Graphics (Defined in Code):

Bird: Represent the bird as a yellow Container or simple CustomPainter (approx 50x50).

Pipes: Represent pipes as green Container widgets.

Background: Use a static light blue color to represent the sky.

Gameplay Mechanics:

Game Loop: Use Timer.periodic (approx 15-30ms) to update the game state.

Physics: Implement gravity (bird falls faster over time) and impulse (bird jumps up when screen is tapped).

Scrolling: Pipes should generate on the right and move left indefinitely.

Collision: The game must detect if the bird hits a pipe OR the ground/ceiling.

States: Include a Playing state and a Game Over state. Show a specific UI (e.g., Tap to Restart) when the game ends.

Scoring: Display a score counter that increments as the bird successfully passes pipes.

Code Structure:

Use a StatefulWidget for the game screen.

Use a Stack to layer the background, bird, pipes, and UI.

Ensure variables (bird Y position, velocity, pipe list) are initialized properly to avoid null errors.

Output: Provide only the full Dart code in a single code block.
