You are a senior Flutter game developer and technical writer. Your task is to generate a fully working Flappy Bird clone written in Flutter (Dart).

Follow ALL requirements carefully. The most important requirement is that the generated project must compile and run with minimal or zero manual fixes.

🎯 Primary Objectives (ordered by priority)
1. Completeness and Buildability (CRITICAL)

The project must:

Be a complete Flutter project

Compile and run immediately after:

flutter pub get
flutter run


Include ALL required files:

pubspec.yaml

lib/main.dart

Any additional Dart files

Asset files if used

Include correct asset declarations in pubspec.yaml

Include clear folder structure

Avoid placeholders like “implement later”

Avoid missing imports or undefined classes

Before finalizing, you must perform a self-verification pass to confirm all files are consistent.

2. Minimize External Dependencies

Use native Flutter and Dart libraries only

Avoid external packages unless absolutely necessary

If a package is used:

Justify why it is unavoidable

Prefer widely supported, lightweight packages

Prefer:

CustomPainter

AnimationController

GestureDetector

Ticker

Built-in audio only if easily available

3. Gameplay Fidelity

Gameplay must resemble original Flappy Bird:

Required mechanics:

Tap / click causes bird to flap upward

Constant gravity pulls bird downward

Horizontally moving pipes

Randomized vertical pipe gaps

Collision detection:

Bird vs pipes

Bird vs ground

Score increments when passing pipes

Game over screen

Restart functionality

Increasing difficulty over time (optional but encouraged)

Physics should feel reasonably similar to the original.

4. Graphics Fidelity

Graphics should resemble original Flappy Bird style:

Preferred approach:

Generate graphics programmatically using Flutter drawing APIs

Acceptable alternative:

Provide image assets AND include them in project structure

Requirements:

Pixel-style or retro aesthetic

Animated bird wing flap

Scrolling background

Ground scrolling effect

Pipes resembling original layout

If images are used:

Provide actual image files as base64 or binary data

Include instructions showing exactly where to place them

5. Sound (Optional)

If implemented:

Use minimal dependency solution

Include:

Flap sound

Score sound

Collision sound

Must not break build if removed

🧱 Architectural Requirements

Use a clean but simple architecture:

Separate files for:

Game state

Bird logic

Pipe logic

Rendering

Collision detection

Avoid over-engineering

Avoid game engines like Flame unless absolutely required (prefer NOT to use)

🗂 Required Output Structure

You MUST output content in this exact order:

1. Project Folder Tree

Show full folder structure.

2. pubspec.yaml

Provide full working file.

3. All Dart Source Files

Each file must:

Be complete

Include imports

Include comments explaining key logic

4. Assets (If Any)

Provide:

File paths

Actual asset data or generation code

5. Build & Run Instructions

Provide exact commands.

6. Self-Verification Checklist

Confirm:

Project compiles

Assets declared correctly

No missing references

No external dependencies unless justified

⚠️ Important Constraints

DO NOT:

Skip files

Use pseudocode

Reference unavailable assets

Assume user knowledge

Use partial snippets

DO:

Provide copy-paste ready files

Prefer single-screen gameplay

Keep code readable and documented

🎮 Target Platforms

Ensure compatibility with:

Android

iOS

Desktop support is optional but welcome

🧪 Quality Expectations

The final result should resemble a small but polished open-source project.
