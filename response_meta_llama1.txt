Flappy Bird's that retro game that's still stuck in everyone's head 😂! Alright, let's break it down:
Brand: 6 - I've heard of it, but I wouldn't say it's a household name anymore. Wasn't it that game that got removed from stores or something?
Game play: 8 - I know it's super simple yet super frustrating - tap to flap, avoid pipes, repeat 😅
Graphics: 9 - Those pixelated birds and green pipes are iconic, even if they're not exactly winning any awards 😂
