Please propose a prompt that will successfully guide an LLM to generate a Flappy Bird clone in Flutter. The objectives are, in order from most to least significant: 1. the project must be complete meaning it should require zero or very few manual changes to compile, build and run. 2. it should use zero or as few external libraries as possible, aiming instead for native Flutter widgets. 3. the gameplay should resemble that of the original game. 4. the graphics should resemble those of the original game. if possible they should be defined in code, but if you choose to use images instead, you must provide those images too. 5. background sound and sound effects are nice to have but not required.
